Some day's ago I've pulled this App from the AppStore as it's mostly obsolete and I've got no time maintaining/updating it. I removed some private credentials and deployed it to GitHub. So here ya go...

From the AppStore Description:

> With BeerBrain you can keep track of your drink's while stying at the Bar.

> Simply select the Beverage you are dinking and have an overview of your costs.

> This App is connected to BreweryDB.com to retrieve a list of Beverages. Please be aware that some of the data in this Database are not up to date. You may, at any time, edit the Beverages you are using inside the App.

> Have fun, but please drink responsible ;-)
